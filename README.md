# ml-base

Base image for machine learning projects using Miniconda and Tensorflow. The idea is you can clone this repo and use it to start a new ML project, just adjust `environment.yml` accordingly.

Currently uses: CUDA 9.0 for use with NVIDIA binary driver 390+

## How Does It Work

You need to have the latest NVIDIA binary driver installed on the host system. Docker will pass privileges to the container so that it can access the video card when needed.

## Usage

### Building the Image

```
docker build -t projectname:tagversion .
```

### Using the Image

```
docker run -it --rm --runtime=nvidia -e UID=$(id -u) -e GID=$(id -g) -e USER=$(whoami) -e DISPLAY="$DISPLAY" -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $(pwd):/code projectname:tagversion [entry-command]
```

#### Jupyter Notebook

To use, append this to the `docker run` command:

```
"jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888"
```
